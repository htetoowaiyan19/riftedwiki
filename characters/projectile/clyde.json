    "passiveDesc": "Aetherwell Energy can be accumulated up to 200% of Clyde's Max HP. When Clyde has Aetherwell Energy, he will transform into Overclocked state. During the Overclocked state, Clyde's Normal and Charged Attacks will be converted into Quantum DMG and deal additional DMG based on 8% of his Aetherwell Energy. During Overclocked state, if Aetherwell Energy is less than 100% of Clyde's Max HP, his Normal Attack Eclipser will fire 1 extra shot, increasing his Aetherwell Energy by 80% of the DMG dealt. When Graviton Mark Protocol is casted during this state, Clyde uses Voidpiercer and launches a Chrono Shard, dealing 68 (+11% Aetherwell Energy) as Physical DMG. If Aetherwell Energy is greater than 100% of Clyde's Max HP, Chrono Shard will deal 211 + (21% Aetherwell Energy) as Quantum DMG, consuming all Aetherwell Energy, healing himself by 40% of his consumed Aetherwell Energy and exiting the Overclocked state. Clyde ignores all healing effects during the Overclocked state.",
